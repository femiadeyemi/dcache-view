        <td align="center">Rename</td>
        <td align="justify">
            Rename a file or folder. Right-click on the file and select <b>Rename</b>
            from the context menu. When you rename a file, only the first part of the
            name of the file is selected, not the file extension (the part after the
            last .) and you usually do not want to change that. If you need to change
            the extension as well, select the entire file name and change it. The
            following are worth noting:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can use any character except the / (slash) character in file names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You cannot have two files or directory with the same name in the same
                    directory. If you try to rename a file to a name that already exists
                    in the folder you are working in, dCache will not allow it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    File and directory names are case sensitive, so the file name
                    Test-File.txt is not the same as TEST-FILE.txt.
                </li>
            </ol>
