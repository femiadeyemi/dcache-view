## Introduction

dCache View is a web application client for [dCache](https://dcache.org). Basically, it 
provide user interface for dCache to the end users, which enable users to interact with 
dCache storage system effortlessly. 

To see how dCache View look like and to have a feel about the application, try our live 
test machine called [Prometheus](https://prometheus.desy.de:3880). This test machine is 
a small dCache instance running the latest development build of dCache with the latest 
released version of dCache View.

## Getting Started

dCache View is part of [Frontend service](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/config-frontend.shtml) 
in dCache. It uses the RESTful API in the frontend for most of the namespace operation. 
Also, it uses [WebDAV services](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/config-frontend.shtml) 
for macaroon, read operation, write operation etc. 

A running dCache instance comes with dCache View. If you are running a system test, you can 
skip this process, since the default layout in system test come with frontend services running 
on different ports. In this case, dCache View will be running in these following: 
http://localhost:3880/ and https://localhost:3881/.

However, if you are interested in other packages apart from the system test, enabling dCache View 
is as simple as starting or adding a frontend service/door to your dCache domain. Say for example, 
you have a single domain called `dCacheDomain`, inside your layout file, which should be located 
at `/etc/dcache/layouts/<name-of-your-layout-file>.conf`. To add the frontend service just add the 
following: `[dCacheDomain/frontend]` also don't forget to add the WebDAV door, as pointed earlier 
dCache View relies on it. Finally, restart your dCache instance. Hence, your layout file should 
look like this:

```text
[dCacheDomain]
.
.
.

[dCacheDomain/webdav]
.
.
.

[dCacheDomain/frontend]

.
.
.
```

By default, dCache View is served from port 3880 but this is configurable 
(see [dCache book](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/book.shtml) for full details on what and how 
to configure all the necessary properties for both webDAV and frontend door).


Ideally, the top of all the supported branches in dCache View [repository](https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view) 
are production ready. If you are brave and want to live on the hedge or fiddle around with 
the source code, you can run the latest version of dCache View but first you need to make 
sure you have [these](#Prerequisites) ready. Next, follow the instruction [here on how to build](#Build) 
it and lastly, deploy it to your system by doing [this](#Update).

#### Prerequisites

- A running dCache instance (see https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/install.shtml on how to install 
    and start a small dCache instance)
- **Git** - see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git on how to install git.
     Your system might have git already installed, check by running the following command: `git --version` 
     from the *terminal*. If you have it installed (or successful install), the result should look similar to:
     ```
     git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)
     ```
- **Maven** - see https://maven.apache.org/install.html on how to install maven.
    After installation (or before installation to check if you have maven installed already), confirm 
    that this is successful, open a *terminal* and typed `mvn -v`. You should see something like:
    ```
    Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T17:41:47+01:00)
    Maven home: /opt/maven-3.3.9
    Java version: 1.8.0_181, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
    Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.13.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
    ```
- Get dCache View source code, use either: 
    ```git
    git clone https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view.git
    ```
    or download the zip file [here](https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view/archive/master.zip)

#### Build

Once you've make sure all the prerequisites requirements are met, open your *terminal* and do 
the following:

- change directory to the directory where you forked/downloaded dCache View: 
    ```sbtshell
    cd <path-to-directory>/dcache-view
    ```
- build 
    ```sbtshell
    mvn clean package
    ```
    
#### Update

After a successful build, directory name `target` will be created inside `dcache-view` folder. We are 
interested in these following files:

    - index.html
    - robots.txt
    - bower_components/
    - elements/
    - favicons/
    - scripts/
    - style/
    
How to update your dCache instant will depends on where it is, if it local, it is as simple as copying
those files listed above to `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/` or it equivalent. To copy these files and 
directories from the `target` directory to `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/`, in the *terminal* typed:
  ```sbtshell
  rm -rf /usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/* && mv -v <path-to-dir>/dcache-view/target/* /usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/
  ``` 
Remembered, this path: `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/` depends on your installation and the package 
you installed. For example, in the system test, this is equivalent to: 
```
<path-to-dcache-directory>/packages/system-test/target/dcache/share/dcache-view/
```

In the case where dCache is running on a remote machine, please use one of the method described 
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server) 
to deploy or replaced the files listed above with the newly generated ones.

        <td align="justify">
            Rename a file or folder. Right-click on the file and select <b>Rename</b>
            from the context menu. When you rename a file, only the first part of the
            name of the file is selected, not the file extension (the part after the
            last .) and you usually do not want to change that. If you need to change
            the extension as well, select the entire file name and change it. The
            following are worth noting:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You can use any character except the / (slash) character in file names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You cannot have two files or directory with the same name in the same
                    directory. If you try to rename a file to a name that already exists
                    in the folder you are working in, dCache will not allow it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    File and directory names are case sensitive, so the file name
                    Test-File.txt is not the same as TEST-FILE.txt.
