## Introduction

dCache View is a web application client for [dCache](https://dcache.org) storage system. 
Basically, it provide user interface to the end users using dCache and enable them to 
interact with dCache storage system effortlessly. 

To see how dCache View looks like and to have a feel about the application, try our live 
test machine called [Prometheus](https://prometheus.desy.de:3880). This test machine is 
a small dCache instance running the latest development build of dCache with the latest 
released version of dCache View.

## Getting Started

dCache View is part of dCache's [frontend service](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/config-frontend.shtml). 
Also, it uses the frontend's [RESTful API](https://prometheus.desy.de:3880/api/v1/) for the 
namespace operations and to communication with dCache. In addition to the frontend service, 
dCache View uses the dCache's [webDAV services](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/config-frontend.shtml) 
for generating macaroons, to perform read and write operation etc. 

A running dCache instance comes with dCache View. For instant, if you are running a 
system-test, all the basic functionality (that will make dCache works out of the box) 
were already set-up for you. It worth mentioning that, the system test have quite a 
few frontend services, which runs on different ports. Hence, you can view dCache View 
at http://localhost:3880/ and https://localhost:3881/. 

__NOTE: You can skip the rest of this part and jump to [how to build](#Build) dCache 
View, if you are running the system-test package.__

However, if you are interested in other packages apart from the system-test, enabling dCache View 
is as simple as starting or adding a frontend service/door to your dCache domain. Say for example, 
you have a single domain called `dCacheDomain`, inside your layout file, which should be located 
at `/etc/dcache/layouts/<name-of-your-layout-file>.conf`. To add the frontend service just add the 
following: `[dCacheDomain/frontend]`. Also don't forget to add the WebDAV door, as pointed out 
earlier dCache View relies on it. Finally, restart your dCache instance. Hence, your layout file 
should look like this:

```text
[dCacheDomain]
.
.
.

[dCacheDomain/webdav]
.
.
.

[dCacheDomain/frontend]

.
.
.
```

By default, dCache View is served from port 3880 but this is configurable 
(see [dCache book](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/book.shtml) for full details on what and how 
to configure all the necessary properties for both webDAV and frontend door).


Ideally, the top of all the supported branches in dCache View [repository](https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view) 
are production ready. If you are brave and want to live on the hedge or (and) fiddle around with 
the source code; you can run the latest version of dCache View but first you need to make 
sure you have [the prerequisites listed here](#Prerequisites) ready. Next, follow the instruction 
described [here on how to build](#Build) dCache View and lastly, deploy it to your system by doing 
what was highlighted [here](#Update/Deployment).

#### Prerequisites

- A running dCache instance (see https://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book-5.0/install.shtml on how to install 
    and start a small dCache instance)
- **Git** - see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git on how to install git.
     Your system might have git already installed, check by running the following command: `git --version` 
     from the *terminal*. If you have it installed (or successful install), the result should look similar to:
     ```
     git version 2.10.1 (Apple Git-78)
     ```
- **Maven** - see https://maven.apache.org/install.html on how to install maven.
    After installation (or before installation to check if you have maven installed already), confirm 
    that this is successful, open a *terminal* and typed `mvn -v`. You should see something like:
    ```
    Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T17:41:47+01:00)
    Maven home: /opt/maven-3.3.9
    Java version: 1.8.0_181, vendor: Oracle Corporation
    Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
    Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.13.6", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
    ```
- Get dCache View source code, use either: 
    ```git
    git clone https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view.git
    ```
    or download the zip file [here](https://github.com/dCache/dcache-view/archive/master.zip)

#### Build

Once you've make sure all the prerequisites requirements are met, open your *terminal* and do 
the following:

- *change directory* to the directory where you forked/downloaded dCache View: 
    ```sbtshell
    cd <path-to-directory>/dcache-view
    ```
- next, *build* with this command
    ```sbtshell
    mvn clean package
    ```

Ensure that the build was successful before you move to the next step, that is, update/deployment. 
To check if it is successful, you should something similar to what is below inside your terminal:

```sbtshell
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 58.926 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2019-01-23T15:41:07+01:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 11M/213M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```    

#### Update/Deployment

After a successful build, directory name `target` will be created inside `dcache-view` folder. We are 
interested in these following generated files/directories:

    - index.html
    - robots.txt
    - bower_components/
    - elements/
    - favicons/
    - scripts/
    - style/
    
How to update (or deploy) dCache View in (or into) your dCache instance will depends on where it is. 
If it is a locally running dCache instance, it is as simple as copying those files/directories listed 
above to `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/` or the equivalent of this path. To copy these files and 
directories from the `target` directory to `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/`, in the *terminal* typed:
  ```sbtshell
  rm -rf /usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/* && mv -v <path-to-dir>/dcache-view/target/* /usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/
  ``` 
Remembered, this path: `/usr/share/dcache/dcache-view/` depends on your installation and the package 
you installed. For example, in the system test, this is equivalent to: 
```
<path-to-dcache-directory>/packages/system-test/target/dcache/share/dcache-view/
```

In the case where dCache is running on a remote machine, please use one of the method described 
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Upload_files_to_a_web_server) 
to deploy or replaced the files listed above with the newly generated ones.
